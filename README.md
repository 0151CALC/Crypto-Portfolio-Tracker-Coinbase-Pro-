# Bitcoin Portfolio Tracker.

This app allows you to track your cryptocurrency investments from the Coinbase Pro exchange.

You will be able to see each fill (buy/sell) and how it is performing in terms of a percentage loss/gain and total.

Also provides up to date graphs which use data that comes stright from the Coinbase Pro exchange.

You will need to generate an API key in Coinbase Pro in order for this app to work for you.

You then need to put the API key infomation into the 'auth' object in the app.js file.

If you are going to be running this in heroku then you are going to want to leave the auth object how it is and instead 
setup the API information in the heroku config environment variables.
